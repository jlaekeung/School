Lowest Common Ancestor 
You are given a general tree. You are asked to identify the lowest common ancestor of two
nodes, i.e. the deepest ancestor of the two given nodes. All nodes only contain a unique
number ranging from 0 to 200.

Your program should read the input from the file, and output the answer to another file. The
The first argument is the input file name, while the second is the output file name.
Name your program as “q3.c”.

Input file: First line, an integer N, indicates the tree's number of nodes. Following n - 1
lines, p n, two integers, node p is the parent of node n. The p in line 2 is the root of the tree.
Last line, a b, two integers, find the lowest common ancestor of node a and node b.

Output file: An integer, l, indicates the lowest common ancestor of node a and node b.

Sample Input:
2
0 1
0 1

Sample Output:
0
